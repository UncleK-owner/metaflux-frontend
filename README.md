## Folder Structure Overview

METAFLUX follows the principles of Clean Architecture to ensure a modular, maintainable, and scalable codebase. Below is an explanation of the folder structure:

### `src/domain/`
This layer contains the core business logic and rules of the application. It is independent of any external frameworks or libraries.

- **`entities/`**: Defines the core entities of the domain, such as `MarkerData`, which represent the fundamental data structures.
- **`repositories/`**: Interfaces for data access, ensuring the domain layer remains decoupled from the infrastructure.
- **`value-objects/`**: Immutable objects that encapsulate specific domain concepts.

### `src/application/`
The application layer contains the use cases and services that orchestrate the business logic.

- **`use-cases/`**: Implements specific business logic, such as `FetchMarkers`, to handle application workflows.
- **`services/`**: Contains reusable service logic that supports the use cases.

### `src/infrastructure/`
This layer provides the implementation details for external systems and frameworks.

- **`api/`**: Handles API communication, such as `MarkerApi`, to interact with external services.
- **`mappers/`**: Transforms data between different layers, ensuring compatibility and consistency.

### `src/presentation/`
The presentation layer is responsible for the user interface and user experience.

- **`components/`**: Reusable React components, such as `MapComponent`, for building the UI.
- **`pages/`**: Page-level components, like `MapsPage`, that structure the application views.

### `index.tsx`
The entry point of the application, responsible for initializing and rendering the React application.

By adhering to this structure, METAFLUX ensures a clear separation of concerns, making the codebase easier to understand, test, and extend.
